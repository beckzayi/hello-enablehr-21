# HTTP Status Codes

enableHR REST APIs use the Status-Line part of an HTTP response message to inform clients of their request’s overarching result.

RFC 2616 defines the Status-Line syntax as shown below:

`Status-Line = HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF`

HTTP defines these standard status codes that can be used to convey the results of a client’s request. The status codes are divided into the five categories.

| Category | Description                                                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1xx:     | Informational – Communicates transfer protocol-level information.                |
| 2xx:     | Success – Indicates that the client’s request was accepted successfully.         |
| 4xx:     | Client Error – This category of error status codes points the finger at clients. |
| 5xx:     | Server Error – The server takes responsibility for these error status codes.     |
