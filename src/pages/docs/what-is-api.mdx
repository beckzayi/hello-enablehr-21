# What is an API

## A simple definition of API

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a bunch of software code that allows two applications to communicate with one another to access data. Open APIs are available for use by anyone and are typically offered as a way to extend services. Obviously, this is all done in a secured and controlled manner. In some cases, use of Open APIs is free, while others require membership or payment. There is no additional cost to use enableHR’s API.

## The need for an API

Open APIs have become a powerful catalyst for digital transformation because they offer a rapid proliferation of capabilities and therefore contribute to the realisation of business value chains that deliver experiences, processes, or data to where they are needed.

At enableHR, we do HR really well. It’s all we do. We believe that a single software system that tries to do everything, to cover every part of a business, might do most things adequately, but won’t do all of them really well. That’s why we stick to making our HR software the most powerful and flexible available.

While our clients love us for our HR capabilities, they also run other functions such as Payroll and Time & Attendance. We don’t do payroll. We don’t do time and attendance. We do HR.

For our clients it is important that enableHR, as the best-in-class HR software for Australian and New Zealand businesses, can work well with the other systems they are using to share data between them.

We believe the best approach for businesses is to use a number of best-in-class systems, each extremely good at what it does, and seamlessly integrate them using API to share data.
