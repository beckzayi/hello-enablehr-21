# Actions

An action endpoint in enableHR OpenAPI is used to submit long running changes to enableHR. A long running change is typically an activity that will change a number of tables and takes more time that a typical CRUD operation.

An action endpoint will return a Location Header with an action status URL. Clients are expected to call this action status URL iteratively till the returned action status is either Failed or Completed.

All action endpoints contain the word actions.

A successful call will return HTTP 202 with an action status URL

{
"actionStatusURL": "http://api.enablehr.com/accounts/{acctId}/action-status/{actionStatusId}"
}
