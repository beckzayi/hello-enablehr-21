## Scopes

### About scopes and permissions for enablehr

To use or manage any resource in enablehr, you must use a token with
the appropriate scope, and your user account must have appropriate
permissions for that resource

For example:

To list employees in your account , your token must
have the read:employees scope, and your user account must have read
permissions for the account

### These are the scopes currently available to the client.

| Scope                       | Description | Permissions |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| manage:employees            |             |             |
| manage:employees:payroll    |             |             |
| read:accounts:referencedata |             |             |
| read:employees              |             |             |
| read:employees:payroll      |             |             |

###

Note: Your OAuth App can request the scopes in the initial
redirection. You can specify multiple scopes by separating them with a
space using %20:

https://login.enablehr.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=...&scope=manage:employees%20manage:employees:payroll

### Requested scopes and granted scopes

The scope attribute lists scopes attached to the token that were
granted by the user. Normally, these scopes will be identical to what
you requested. However, users can edit their scopes, effectively
granting your application less access than you originally
requested. You should be aware of this possibility and adjust
your application's behavior accordingly.

It's important to handle error cases where a user chooses to grant you
less access than you originally requested. For example, applications
can warn or otherwise communicate with their users that they will see
reduced functionality or be unable to perform some actions.

Also, applications can always send users back through the flow again
to get additional permission, but donâ€™t forget that users can always
say no.
